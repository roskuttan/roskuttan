# Hello, I'm Angelo Rison! ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Thrissur, Kerala, India, and I really like working with technology, especially robotics and automation.

## My Skills
- Programming: Python and C++
- Robotics: ROS2
- Electronics: Basic Fabrication, Circuit and PCB Design
- 3D Design: Fusion 360

## What I'm Doing Now
I'm developing a 6-DOF robotic arm using ROS2, with the goal of automating a specific task. It's an exciting project that helps me apply my technical skills.

## Future Plan
After completing the project, I plan to make it open-source. I hope it will be useful for the community and inspire others to create and share their own projects.

## Let's Connect!
I always enjoy meeting other tech enthusiasts and people interested in robotics and automation. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](angelococ2018@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelo-rison). Let's share ideas and learn from each other!
